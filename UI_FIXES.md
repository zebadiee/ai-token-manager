### üîç Current Status

**OpenRouter** ‚úÖ
- Working perfectly
- 326 models loaded successfully
- API key valid

**HuggingFace** ‚ùå
- HTTP 403 error
- Issue: "This authentication method does not have sufficient permissions to call Inference Providers"
- The API token doesn't have the right scopes

## How to Fix HuggingFace

### The Problem
Your HuggingFace API token needs additional permissions. The error says:
```
This authentication method does not have sufficient permissions to 
call Inference Providers on behalf of user zebadiee
```

### The Solution

1. **Get a New Token with Correct Permissions**:
   - Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Click "New token" or edit existing token
   - **Important**: Select "Read" permission at minimum
   - For inference API, you may need "Write" permission
   - Save the token

2. **Update in the App**:
   - Go to Provider Management in sidebar
   - Remove the current HuggingFace provider
   - Add it again with the new token
   - Save configuration

### Alternative: Use OpenRouter Only

Since OpenRouter is working perfectly with 326 models available, you can:

1. **Remove HuggingFace provider** (it's not working anyway)
2. **Use OpenRouter** - it has access to many models including:
   - Claude (Anthropic)
   - GPT models (OpenAI)
   - Llama models (Meta)
   - DeepSeek models
   - And 320+ more

## Updated Features

### Chat Tab
- **Provider Selector**: Choose active provider from dropdown
- **Refresh Models Button**: Loads models with status feedback
- **Next Button**: Quick switch to next provider
- **Status Display**: Shows current provider and API key status

### Provider Management
- **Provider Selector**: Choose which provider is active
- **Current Marker**: ‚≠ê shows which provider is currently selected
- **Working Remove Button**: Actually removes providers now
- **Status Indicators**: 
  - üü¢ = Active
  - üîë = Has API key
  - ‚ùå = No API key

## Diagnostic Tools

### Check Provider Status
```bash
cd ~/ai-token-manager
source venv/bin/activate
python diagnose_providers.py
```

This will show:
- Which providers are configured
- Which have valid API keys
- Model loading status
- Specific error messages

### Check API Keys
```bash
python check_keys.py
```

Shows:
- Environment variables set
- Providers configured
- API key status
