# Bug Fix Report

## Issue: Application Error on Startup

### Problem
When running the Streamlit application, it crashed with the error:
```
Application error: 'str' object has no attribute 'value'
```

### Root Cause
The `ProviderStatus` enum was being serialized to JSON incorrectly:

1. **During save**: The `asdict()` function converted the enum to a string representation like `"ProviderStatus.ACTIVE"`, which was then saved to JSON
2. **During load**: This string was read back but NOT converted back to an enum
3. **During use**: The `get_provider_status()` method tried to call `.value` on a string, causing the crash

### Fix Applied
Modified two methods in `enhanced_multi_provider_manager.py`:

#### 1. `save_config()` method (line ~497)
Added proper enum-to-string conversion:
```python
# Convert enum to string value
if isinstance(provider_data['status'], ProviderStatus):
    provider_data['status'] = provider_data['status'].value
elif isinstance(provider_data['status'], str) and '.' in provider_data['status']:
    # Handle already stringified enum like "ProviderStatus.ACTIVE"
    provider_data['status'] = provider_data['status'].split('.')[-1].lower()
```

#### 2. `load_config()` method (line ~520)
Added proper string-to-enum conversion:
```python
# Convert usage dict to TokenUsage object
if 'usage' in provider_data and isinstance(provider_data['usage'], dict):
    provider_data['usage'] = TokenUsage(**provider_data['usage'])

# Convert string status to enum
if 'status' in provider_data and isinstance(provider_data['status'], str):
    # Handle both "active" and "ProviderStatus.ACTIVE" formats
    status_str = provider_data['status'].split('.')[-1] if '.' in provider_data['status'] else provider_data['status']
    provider_data['status'] = ProviderStatus(status_str)
```

### Additional Fix
Also fixed the `TokenUsage` serialization - it was being loaded as a dict instead of a `TokenUsage` object, causing similar attribute errors.

### Testing
Created `test_enum_fix.py` to verify:
- ✅ Status is saved as enum value string ("active", not "ProviderStatus.ACTIVE")
- ✅ Status is loaded back as ProviderStatus enum
- ✅ `get_provider_status()` returns string values correctly
- ✅ No more AttributeError

### Fixed Existing Config
Also created a script to fix the existing config file that had the old format with `"ProviderStatus.ACTIVE"` strings.

### Verification
All tests now pass:
- Unit tests: ✅ 6/6
- Smoke test: ✅ All passing
- Enum fix test: ✅ All passing
- Diagnostics: ✅ System healthy

The Streamlit application now starts and runs correctly without errors.
